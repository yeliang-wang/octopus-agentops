# Release Readiness

Octopus AgentOps uses a public-beta release bar. The toolkit can be released when its subagents are installable, loop-capable, drift-checkable, and auditable from the local checkout.

## Release Level

Current target: `public-beta`.

This means:

- Every packaged agent is at least `beta`.
- Every packaged plugin is at least `beta`.
- Every agent has a structured `loopContract`.
- Every agent has a `runtimeAdapters.codexGoal` plan.
- Generated Codex TOML and catalogs are current.
- Deterministic eval and install roundtrip pass.
- Package metadata and license are ready for public distribution.

It does not mean the toolkit is a general-purpose agent runtime or orchestration framework.

## Required Gate

Run:

```bash
npm run release:check
```

For machine-readable evidence:

```bash
npm run release:check -- --json
```

The gate runs or verifies:

| Area | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Package metadata | name, semver, public package flag, license, `LICENSE` file |
| Lifecycle | no `experimental` packaged agents or plugins |
| Loop plans | `loopContract`, required loop state fields, Codex goal adapter, artifact plan |
| Loop goal window | every packaged agent requires explicit final goal, phase goals, acceptance criteria, report cadence, and final decision |
| Release coverage matrix loop | every packaged agent requires coverage matrix, evidence map, blocker policy, repair policy, release decision, and per-phase decision chain |
| Production representative sandbox | shared local representative project set is contract-checked and forbidden from counting as release evidence until target-product registration and real boundaries are proven |
| Production release rule | every packaged agent forbids mock/fake/stub/simulator/fixture-only/demo-only/smoke-only/chat-only release evidence |
| Docs | README release section and docs for release and competitive baseline |
| Commands | manifest validation, distribution check, catalog check, deterministic eval, whitespace check, Codex install drift |

## Loop Goal Window

Every loop-capable packaged subagent must establish a `Loop Goal Window` before starting or resuming a loop. The window is part of the release contract, not optional prompt guidance.

Required fields:

- `finalGoal`: the terminal objective for the loop.
- `phaseGoals`: staged objectives for the current release, validation, or evolution phase.
- `currentPhase`: the active phase being worked now.
- `acceptanceCriteria`: evidence-backed criteria needed before completion can be claimed.
- `targetPlan`: the proposed loop plan, including final target, phase targets, per-phase acceptance criteria, coverage rows, evidence sources, blocker policy, repair policy, report cadence, and final decision vocabulary.
- `targetPlanConfirmation`: the user's explicit confirmation or requested edits before loop execution.
- `reportCadence`: when the agent reports progress, blockers, and next actions.
- `finalDecision`: the explicit terminal decision such as `DONE`, `BLOCKED`, `NO-GO`, or `NOT_RELEASE_READY`.

The release gate requires these fields in `loopContract.goalWindow`, `loopContract.stateFields`, and loop inputs where user input is needed. Agents may infer missing target details from context or product-native discovery, but the inferred plan must be presented to the user as a confirmation proposal before the loop starts or resumes. Require explicit user confirmation before entering the loop. If the target plan is unconfirmed, agents must stop as `BLOCKED: pending loop target plan confirmation`; they must not run loop actions from an unconfirmed plan. Agents must also stop or report `BLOCKED` instead of running indefinitely when the final goal, acceptance criteria, or final decision cannot be established.

## Release Coverage Matrix Loop

For release, release-readiness, GA, public-beta, production-grade, or long-running product lifecycle goals, every packaged subagent must convert the goal window into a `Release Coverage Matrix Loop` before running.

Required loop fields:

- `coverageMatrix`: rows for product capabilities, scenarios, connected projects or systems, required evidence, status, blocker, and next repair action.
- `iterationPlan`: the next phase sequence needed to move matrix rows from `NOT_RUN`, `FAIL`, or `BLOCKED` toward `PASS`.
- `evidenceMap`: the product-native command, API, UI, CI/CD, SCM, runtime, artifact, or decision source backing each matrix row.
- `blockerPolicy`: rules for when missing product boundaries, repeated failures, or non-production substitutes become `BLOCKED`, `NO-GO`, or not release-ready.
- `repairPolicy`: diagnosis, productized repair, verification, escalation, and stop rules for repeated blockers.
- `releaseDecision`: the current explicit decision, such as `GO`, `CONDITIONAL-GO`, `NO-GO`, `BLOCKED`, or `NOT_RELEASE_READY`.
- `decisionChain`: the 阶段决策链 printed for every phase.

Every phase report must print the decision chain that led to its conclusion:

```text
phase:
evidence:
rule:
options:
decision:
rationale:
nextAction:
```

## Project Profile Execution

Release execution is generic through `agent-octopus-project-profile/v1`. The project profile is the anti-corruption layer between toolkit governance and a target product runtime:

- toolkit core owns loop cadence, target plan confirmation, compact state, artifact externalization, event logs, coverage status, blocker policy, and decision-chain reporting.
- project profiles declare health endpoints, commands, HTTP checks, external boundaries, production representative registration, release evidence, and product-native release decisions.
- optional project adapters may translate target-product APIs into the profile contract, but they must not weaken toolkit release rules.

The generic runner is:

```bash
npm run release:runner -- --profile <octopus.project.json>
```

If `targetPlanConfirmation.status` is not `confirmed`, the runner writes `BLOCKED: pending loop target plan confirmation` and exits without executing release actions.

Health checks, process keepalive, smoke checks, or repeating the same failed path do not count as release progress by themselves. If the same blocker repeats, the agent must switch from rerun mode into diagnosis, productized repair, and verification; if that cannot be done under the current permissions or product boundary, the loop must stop as `BLOCKED` or `NO-GO`.

## Production Representative Sandbox

When real customer production projects are unavailable in a local environment, release coverage matrix loops may use the shared Production Representative Sandbox:

```text
sandbox/production-representative/manifest.json
```

The sandbox provides representative project templates for backend API, Dashboard UI, MCP/tool contract, evidence data pipeline, and quality-gate failure/repair behavior. Generated repositories live under `data/production-representative-sandbox/` and are not committed.

These projects count as release evidence only after all of the following are proven:

- The projects are generated or selected as real Git repositories.
- Their real validation commands pass or fail with captured evidence.
- The target product registers them through its own API or data path.
- Real SCM, CI/CD, LLM/runtime, and product-native evidence boundaries are used.
- Every phase prints the decision chain for using or rejecting the representative projects.

If any required boundary is missing, inaccessible, or replaced by a non-production substitute, the affected matrix row is `BLOCKED` or `NO-GO`. Template-only, mock-only, fixture-only, smoke-only, or chat-only representative projects do not count as release evidence.

## Toolkit-Wide Production Release Rule

For product-grade, production-like, release-candidate, GA, or release-readiness work, no packaged subagent may use mock, fake, stub, simulator, fixture-only, demo-only, smoke-only, or chat-only evidence as production release evidence.

- Smoke checks may prove connectivity only; they are not release validation.
- If a required runtime, model, SCM, CI/CD, data, approval, rollback, observability, or product API boundary is missing or replaced by a non-production substitute, the result must be `NO-GO`, `BLOCKED`, or not release-ready.
- Unit tests may still use controlled fakes, but release claims require real processes, real APIs, real credentials, real SCM, real CI/CD, real product data paths, and product-native release evidence where available.

## Promotion Rules

Use these lifecycle levels consistently:

| Lifecycle | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `experimental` | Not eligible for public release. Contract may still change materially. |
| `beta` | Eligible for public-beta release. Contract is explicit, validated, generated, and installable. |
| `production-ready` | Reserved for agents with repeated real-project evidence across supported runtimes. |

Promoting an agent to `beta` requires:

1. A manifest with explicit inputs, outputs, evidence, confirmation gates, dangerous actions, `loopContract`, and `runtimeAdapters.codexGoal`.
2. Canonical Markdown source with `Goal-Driven Loop Mode`.
3. Generated Codex TOML with `Codex Goal Runtime Adapter`.
4. `npm run validate`, `npm run eval`, and `npm run release:check` passing.
5. README and AGENT-LIST references.

## Codex Loop Evidence

Each Codex loop plan must define:

- Outer goal runtime: Codex `/goal`.
- Inner loop protocol: selected Octopus agent.
- Loop goal window: `finalGoal`, `phaseGoals`, `currentPhase`, `acceptanceCriteria`, `reportCadence`, and `finalDecision`.
- Release coverage matrix fields: `coverageMatrix`, `iterationPlan`, `evidenceMap`, `blockerPolicy`, `repairPolicy`, `releaseDecision`, and `decisionChain`.
- Per-phase decision chain: `phase`, `evidence`, `rule`, `options`, `decision`, `rationale`, and `nextAction`.
- `loopState` fields including `goal`, `blocker`, `nextAction`, and `stopCondition`.
- State artifact: `data/<agent-domain>/<projectId>/loop-state.json`.
- Status artifact: `data/<agent-domain>/<projectId>/current-status.md`.
- Evidence root: `data/<agent-domain>/<projectId>/evidence/`.
- Summary state only: `loop-state.json` stores compact counters, status, blocker, next action, decision IDs, artifact paths, bounded evidence snippets, and never full product API responses.
- Iteration artifacts: large release decisions, risk registers, logs, traces, screenshots, stdout/stderr, and evidence bundles are externalized to per-iteration artifacts and referenced from state.
- JSONL summary events: loop logs record event type, attempt, timestamp, compact release decision, compact counters, blocker, and next action, not full result payloads.
- Resume and state size guard: loops resume from the persisted attempt and product-native evidence store after restart, and must compact or externalize state before a state write exceeds its configured size budget.

If the target project cannot persist these artifacts, the agent must report the same fields in chat and stop on missing evidence rather than claiming release readiness.

## Release Checklist

Before tagging or publishing:

```bash
npm run generate -- --check
npm run validate
npm run check
npm run eval
npm run agents:codex-status
npm run release:check
git diff --check
```

Then inspect:

```bash
git status --short --branch
git diff --stat
```

Do not claim a stable GA release while any packaged agent remains `beta`.
